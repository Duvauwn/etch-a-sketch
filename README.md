# Etch-a-Sketch

This project will be very dificult but will be a good learning experience for me. It'll also be a good inclusion for my portfolio!

The aim of this project is to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-a-Sketch

# 16x16 grid

The first part of this project is to make a 16x16 grid of square divs. The divs have to be made using JavaScript.

# Hovering

the second part of this project is to make a hover effect so that the grid divs change color when the mouse passes over them,leaving a trail through the grid like a pen would.

# The Button

The third and final part of this project is to add a button to the page. When clicked the button should delete te 16x16 grid and prompt the user for another grid size. When the user inputs their answer it should then generate a grid of that size but it should also take up the same amount of space as the old grid.
This is the hardest part as it includes a lot of reworking of old code.
