# Etch-a-Sketch

This project will be very dificult but will be a good learning experience for me. It'll also be a good inclusion for my portfolio!

The aim of this project is to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-a-Sketch

# 16x16 grid

The first part of this project is to make a 16x16 grid of square divs. The divs have to be made using JavaScript.

# Hovering

the second part of this project is to make a hover effect so that the grid divs change color when the mouse passes over them,leaving a trail through the grid like a pen would.
